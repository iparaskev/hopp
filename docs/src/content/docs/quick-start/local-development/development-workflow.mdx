## Backend Setup

Before the first run, you need to set up the web app dependencies, database, Redis Docker containers, and create certificates:

```bash
# Install all workspace dependencies from the root
yarn install

# Create SSL certificates for local development
task backend:create-certs

# Start Docker containers for PostgreSQL and Redis
task backend:compose-up

# Add mock data to the database
task backend:add-mock-data
```

The mock data adds test users to the database, by default it adds `michael@dundermifflin.com` and `dwight@dundermifflin.com`.

After the initial setup, **start the backend with the local LiveKit server**:

```bash
task dev-server
```

You can change the server's configuration in the `env-files/.env.local` file.

## Tauri App Development

Then you can start the Tauri desktop application:

```bash
task tauri:dev
```

You can get an authentication token with:

```bash
task backend:user-token EMAIL=michael@dundermifflin.com
```

To connect then you need to paste the generated token inside the `Debug` screen inside the app.


<Image src={connect} class="rounded-md w-full mx-auto mt-6" alt="Connect app to account" />


For debugging purposes, you can spawn a clone of the app:

```bash
task tauri:start-replica-app
```

And generated a token for `Dwight` user with command:

```bash
task backend:user-token EMAIL=dwight@dundermifflin.com
```

Then you can make Dwight call Michael.

## Exposing Services to the Internet

You can expose the backend and LiveKit server to the internet by creating a tunnel. There are multiple tools available for this; one popular option is `cloudflared`.

### Example Cloudflared Configuration

Create a `config.yml` file with the following configuration:

```yaml
tunnel: <tunnel-id>
credentials-file: <path-to-credentials-file>

ingress:
  - hostname: <hostname>
    service: https://localhost:1926

  - hostname: <livekit_hostname>
    service: ws://localhost:7880

  - service: http_status:404
```

This configuration will:

- Expose the backend API (running on port 1926) via HTTPS
- Expose the LiveKit server (running on port 7880) via WebSocket
- Return a 404 for any other requests

Don't forget to update the server's configuration in `env-files/.env.local` when you expose the services to the internet.

Then you have to set the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable before running the Tauri app.
